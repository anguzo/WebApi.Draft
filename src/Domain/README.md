## Domain Layer

The domain layer establishes the foundation for the core business rules and logic.

In his seminal work, *Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture*, Martin Fowler defines a Domain Model as:
> "An object model of the domain that incorporates both behavior and data."

Currently, the domain layer does not encapsulate distinct behavior or boundaries, indicative of an Anemic Domain Model. As the application evolves, the necessity to introduce and define these behaviors and boundaries will become increasingly evident.

### Common

The `Common` directory houses essential interfaces and abstract classes, underpinning the system's architectural integrity.

### Entities

The `Entities` directory is dedicated to domain entities.


Eric Evans begins a chapter dedicated to Entities in his renowned book *Domain-Driven Design* with the insightful phrase:
> "Many objects are not fundamentally defined by their attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and identity."


This statement accentuates that the primary attributes defining an Entity are its continuity and identity.
